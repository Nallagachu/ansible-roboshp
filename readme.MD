Introduction
The ansible-roboshp project is a collection of Ansible playbooks and roles for automating the setup and management of a fictional "RoboShop" application. This could include tasks such as:

Installing dependencies

Configuring services

Deploying application components

Managing users and permissions

Setting up basic monitoring or logging (depending on the scope)

It serves as a foundational template that can be adapted for various automation needs.

Features
Modular Playbooks: Organized into specific tasks for clarity and reusability.

Role-Based Structure: Utilizes Ansible roles for better organization of tasks, variables, and templates.

Parameterized Configuration: Allows for easy customization through Ansible variables.

Idempotent Operations: Playbooks are designed to be run multiple times without causing unintended side effects.

Prerequisites
Before using these Ansible playbooks, ensure you have the following:

Ansible: Installed on your control machine (the machine from which you will run Ansible).

pip install ansible

Target Hosts: Access to the target machines (servers) that you intend to manage with Ansible. These hosts must be reachable via SSH.

SSH Keys: Proper SSH key-based authentication set up between your control machine and target hosts (recommended).

Python: Python installed on target hosts (Ansible requires Python to run its modules).

How to Use
Cloning the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Nallagachu/ansible-roboshp.git
cd ansible-roboshp

Inventory Setup
Update the inventory/hosts.ini file with the IP addresses or hostnames of your target machines. Organize them into appropriate groups as needed by the playbooks.

Example inventory/hosts.ini:

[webservers]
web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10
web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11

[databases]
db1 ansible_host=192.168.1.20

[all:vars]
ansible_user=ubuntu
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa

Running Playbooks
To run a specific playbook, use the ansible-playbook command:

# Example: Run the main deployment playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini playbooks/deploy_roboshop.yml

# Example: Run a playbook with extra variables
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini playbooks/configure_services.yml --extra-vars "app_version=2.0"

Replace inventory/hosts.ini with the path to your inventory file and playbooks/deploy_roboshop.yml with the playbook you wish to execute.

Customization
Variables: Adjust variables in inventory/group_vars/all.yml or within specific roles' vars/main.yml files to customize application settings, paths, versions, and more.

Roles: Modify existing roles or create new ones in the roles/ directory to extend functionality.

Playbooks: Adapt the playbooks in playbooks/ to orchestrate tasks according to your specific application deployment workflow.
